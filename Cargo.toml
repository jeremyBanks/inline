#! ## Crate Feature Flags

#! ### Serialization Formats

## Support (de)serializing string/byte literals as JSON using `serde` via the `.edit_json()` methods.
json = ["serde", "std", "serde_json"]

## Support (de)serializing byte literals as Postcard using `serde` via the `.edit_postcard()` methods.
postcard = ["serde", "dep:postcard"]

## Support (de)serializing string/byte literals as TOML using `serde` via the `.edit_toml()` methods.
toml = ["serde", "std", "dep:toml"]

## Support (de)serializing string/byte literals as YAML using `serde` via the `.edit_yaml()` methods.
yaml = ["serde", "std", "serde_yaml"]

#! ### Core Capabilities

## Support for writing literal mutations back to their source file.
write = ["mut", "token-tree"]

## Support for "mutating" literals.
mut = ["std", "parking_lot", "once_cell/parking_lot"]

## Include features that may panic on error. (Disabling does **not** prevent all panics (yet?).)
panic = []

#! ### Testing Tools

## Include assertion functions for snapshot testing.
assertions = ["write", "panic", "mut"]

#! ### Forbidding Features
#!
#! These flags are obviously "non-additive" (contra [the normal recommendation][1]),
#! so they should typically only be activated by the root binary, not libraries.
#! These don't disable the corresponding features directly; you'll still need to use `default-features = false`.
#! Rather, these flags will raise a compile errors if the corresponding features are enabled,
#! to help catch cases where they may inadvertently be reenabled by other crates.
#! These flags are ignored in `--all-features` builds.
#!

#- ### Internal Features

#- Include `crate::token_tree` and features that require it.
